#iPhone Price Predictor
This is a simple project that predicts the price of an iPhone based on its version using a linear regression model. The project uses the pandas library for data manipulation and the scikit-learn library for building the linear regression model.

#Description
This project aims to predict the price of an iPhone based on its version number. The idea is to help buyers and sellers to get an estimate of the iPhone price, and make informed decisions based on the predicted value.

The project uses a linear regression model to predict the price, which is a statistical approach that can identify relationships between the independent variable (in this case, the iPhone version) and the dependent variable (the iPhone price).
